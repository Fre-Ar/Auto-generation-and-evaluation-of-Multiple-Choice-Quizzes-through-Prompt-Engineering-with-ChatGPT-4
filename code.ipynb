    "    • Analyze - At this level, learners break material into constituent parts, determine how the parts relate to one another and to an overall structure or purpose through differentiating, organizing.\n",
    "    • Evaluate - This level involves making judgments based on criteria and standards through checking and critiquing.\n",
    "    • Create - At this level, learners put elements together to form a coherent or functional whole, or they reorganize elements into a new pattern or structure through generating.\n",

    "    Difficulty levels:\n",
    "    Multiple-choice questions must be obey certain rules to make sure the difficulty of the MCQ is appropriate:\n",
    "    • Beginner - The question should be simple, the correct answer(s) should be obvious and the distractors should be easy to distinguish from the correct answer(s).\n",
